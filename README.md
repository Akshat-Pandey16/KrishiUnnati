## About The Project

India is predominantly an agricultural country. Farming is a major occupation in India and one of the biggest 
challenges which comes when a huge workforce is occupied, is that it becomes very difficult to provide 
personal attention to every farmer. To help the farmers improve in agricultural sector, we propose a web-based application " कृषि Unnati". 
Through the web app we will provide online teleconsultation services as 
well as offline alternatives to farmers. They can get support in various agricultural activities, by the help of 
consultants as well as connect with their peers through the web app. 

The UI for the कृषि Unnati site will be user friendly & very easy to use, especially with the help of our 
multilingual voice assistant. For visual inspection of plants, our application will use crop image detection to 
diagnose the health of the crop and provide suitable cures. A National database will be maintained using the 
details entered by the farmers in their profiles, which will be analyzed to produce national stats regarding the 
crop production of the country. Through a very easy to understand and convenient layout, the कृषि Unnati
web app is aimed to assist the entire farmer population of India, including small farmers from remote 
areas through alternative offline services.
